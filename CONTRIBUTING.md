# Contributing to Blaze

## How to run your app with the future version of Blaze to test it?

First, you have to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/meteor/blaze.git
```

Let's assume you cloned it into `/home/user/projects/blaze`.

You can use `master` branch which contains the work for next Blaze version, or you can switch to various
feature branches where we are developing new features.
You can see the name of the branch at the top of the GitHub pull request with work on that branch.

### Temporary

If you want to just temporary use the Blaze packages from the repository, you can run Meteor inside your app like:

```bash
METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS=/home/user/projects/blaze/packages meteor
```

### Using symlinks

You can also create a `packages` directory inside your app (if you do not already have it) and
make symlinks for every package in the Blaze repository. Like:

```
ln -s /home/user/projects/blaze/packages/blaze packages/
ln -s /home/user/projects/blaze/packages/blaze-html-templates packages/
...
```

### Run local tests

The `test-app` folder contains a bare Meteor project you can utilize for local
testing. In order to run local tests, please setup the project first:

#### Setting up the local test environment

Everything is already prepared in scripts:

```bash
$ cd test-app
$ meteor npm install   # install dependencies
$ meteor npm run setup # create link to packages
```

This has to be done only once.

#### Run the linter

We use eslint with the [quave config](https://github.com/quavedev/eslint-config), which is also used
by the Meteor core project.

Due to the fact, that this repo consists of multiple packages, you should run the linter for single packages
like so:

```bash
$ cd test-app
$ meteor npm run lint:check -- ./packages/templating-compiler 
```

If you need to lint other packages, use `.packages/<nameOfPackage>` or use `./packages/` to lint all packages.
Beware, however, that this might take a while to lint all packages.

The same goes for autofixing common lint errors:

```bash
$ cd test-app
$ meteor npm run lint:check -- ./packages/templating-compiler
```

#### Run the tests

Simply execute the test script:

```bash
$ meteor npm run test:watch
```
