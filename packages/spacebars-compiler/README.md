# Spacebars Compiler

The Spacebars compiler that is invoked at build time to compile templates to JavaScript.

While this code is not normally ever shipped to the client, it can be used at runtime on the server or the client by using the `SpacebarsCompiler` symbol from this package.

The `spacebars` package, in contrast, contains the `Spacebars` symbol and the Spacebars runtime, which is shipped to the client as part of the app.
