## What is Blaze?

Blaze is a powerful library for creating user interfaces by writing reactive HTML templates.  Compared to using a combination of traditional templates and jQuery, Blaze eliminates the need for all the "update logic" in your app that listens for data changes and manipulates the DOM.  Instead, familiar template directives like ``{{#if}}`` and ``{{#each}}`` integrate with [Tracker's](https://meteor.com/tracker) "transparent reactivity" and [Minimongo's](https://meteor.com/mini-databases) database cursors so that the DOM updates automatically. 

### Blaze has two major parts:

* A template compiler that compiles template files into JavaScript code that runs against the Blaze runtime library.  Moreover, Blaze provides a compiler toolchain (think LLVM) that can be used to support arbitrary template syntaxes.  The flagship template syntax is Spacebars, a variant of Handlebars, but a community alternative based on Jade is already in use by many apps.

* A reactive DOM engine that builds and manages the DOM at runtime, invoked via templates or directly from the app, which features reactively updating regions, lists, and attributes; event delegation; and many callbacks and hooks to aid the app developer.

## Quick Start

Blaze is a [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)-only package for now. Sooner we will have Blaze on npm so you can use it in your stack.

A new Meteor project has Blaze included.
